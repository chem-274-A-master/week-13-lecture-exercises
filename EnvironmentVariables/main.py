"""
Environment variable exercise.

Working with environment variables.

Environment variables are key-value pairs that programs use to store configuration settings. 
In Python, you can interact with these variables using a built-in module.

You should implement the function `set_my_var` that sets an environment variable called `my_var` 
to the value `'value'` and returns the value of the variable after setting it.
"""

# You will need to add an import


def set_my_var():
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Main for demonstration

    # Call the function to set the environment variable
    value = set_my_var()

    # Print the value of the environment variable
    print(f"The value of 'my_var' is: {value}")
